        <p>I suffer from chronic fatigue (CFS) and fibromyalgia and have for quite a few years now. In that time I&#8217;ve had to learn my new limits and to try not to compare myself to others who don&#8217;t have these issues. Which is easier said than done. </p>



        <p>Still, since moving to England I&#8217;ve managed my conditions fairly well. My chronic fatigue is ever-present, and I honestly don&#8217;t remember what the feeling of waking up well-rested feels like. (Is it even a thing? I don&#8217;t know anymore.) But I handled the fatigue well enough that I could hold down a full-time job, even if I was exhausted outside of work hours and managed little else. As for the pain, I have learned my limits. I know how far I can walk without it resulting in excruciating pain, and I know which activities just don&#8217;t work for me.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>On occasion, I still over-do it of course. It&#8217;s impossible not to. I had to go to London last week to visit the Embassy and apply for a new passport. I wore a pair of boots that aren&#8217;t my usual well-walked shoes, and we did a lot of walking for several hours. That evening and the next two days I could barely move. For the most part, I do manage not to get into that situation.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>In general, I feel like I have a better handle on the pain than the fatigue. The pain is endurable, while the fatigue is what really gets me.* It&#8217;s what keeps me from doing a lot of things. I just can&#8217;t find the energy a lot of the time. And I hate it.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>I hated it before. I hate it even more now that I have the tiny tyrant. Mum guilt is a thing that all mothers struggle with, I think, and I definitely suffer with it. I feel like I really have things to feel guilty about. </p>
        
        
        
        <p>There are times when we don&#8217;t make it out of the house for a few days, because I just cannot muster the energy. And I feel like the worst mum ever.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>There are times when she wants me to sit with her on the floor and build blocks, legos, trains&#8230; and I can only do a short while before my pain makes it impossible and I have to get up. And I feel like the worst mum ever.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>There are times when I&#8217;m so exhausted I just want to sit in a corner and cry because I can&#8217;t find the energy to give my child everything I wish I could. And I feel like the worst mum ever.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>There are times when there are toys all over the floor and the laundry pile is bigger than the clean pile, and the dishes cover the kitchen counter, and I just can&#8217;t bring myself to tidy up. And I feel like the worst mum ever.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>There are times when I visit my friends with kids, and I see their spotless homes, I see all the things they do with their kids every day, I see them do all the things I wish I could. And I feel like the worst mum ever.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>I think every mum probably feels inadequate in one way or another, and I&#8217;m in no way trying to downplay those feelings for other mums. This is really just a post for me to get my own feelings out, trying to sort them through in my head. A lot of the times I just feel like such a useless waste of space, and it&#8217;s not a great feeling. People telling me I&#8217;m not, while I appreciate their sentiments&#8230; it just doesn&#8217;t make me feel any better. It doesn&#8217;t change the facts. I try not to compare myself to people who don&#8217;t have my conditions, but it&#8217;s hard. And some days I think even people with my conditions probably manage better than I do.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Still, I have a happy child (for the most part) who is hitting all her milestones (except height/weight!) and can entertain herself for stretches of time since she&#8217;s had to when mummy just isn&#8217;t able to play with her for a while. And that&#8217;s what I need to remind myself of. Every day.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>What&#8217;s your worst mum guilt?</p>
